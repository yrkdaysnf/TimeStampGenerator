**TimeStamp Generator** -  free, *open-source* application tailored for those looking to add a touch of *vintage* to their videos or images. While not all cameras have the capability to embed timestamps, this application allows you to overlay timestamps onto their media, enhancing the *retro aesthetic*. Itâ€™s perfect for creators and enthusiasts who appreciate the classic look of dated footage, providing an *authentic* timestamp that can transform modern recordings into *nostalgic* masterpieces. You can select the *font, color, position, and other settings* to ensure the timestamp perfectly complements your media.

>Any assistance in the development of the project is accepted. In particular, code optimization, project assembly (as far as possible), tests and bug detection.
